AUTHOR: AVINASH TANTI

This repository documents my progress through the 2 Week Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130 workshop with complete RTL2GDSII flow organized by VSD as part of Level-3 of Chip Design for High School Program in collaboration with Intel India

## Section 1 - Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE, and Sky130 PDK DAY-1

## Introduction

**ASIC** stands for **Application-Specific Integrated Circuit**. An ASIC is a type of integrated circuit (IC) that is designed for a specific application or purpose. Unlike general-purpose ICs such as microprocessors or memory chips, which are designed to perform a wide range of functions, ASICs are tailored to perform a single function or a set of closely related functions efficiently.
## Types of ASICs

1. **Full-Custom ASICs**:
   - Designed from scratch, offering maximum performance and customization.
   - Require significant time, expertise, and cost for development.

2. **Semi-Custom ASICs**:
   - Utilize pre-designed and pre-verified blocks (IP cores or libraries) along with custom-designed portions.
   - Strike a balance between performance and design effort.

3. **Programmable ASICs (FPGAs)**:
   - While not strictly ASICs, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer reconfigurable logic.
   - Can be programmed to perform specific functions, providing flexibility similar to ASICs but with less performance optimization.

## ASIC Design Flow

The ASIC design flow outlines the process of designing and fabricating an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit. The flow can be boardly be clasified into **Front End** & **Back End**:<br>

-**Front End** involes the following steps:

1. **Specification and Architecture Definition**:
   - Define the requirements and functionality of the ASIC.
   - Create the architectural design, including block diagrams and high-level logic.

2. **RTL Design and Simulation**:
   - Write Register Transfer Level (RTL) code using hardware description languages like Verilog or VHDL.
   - Simulate the RTL design to verify functionality and performance using tools like ModelSim or VCS.

3. **Synthesis & Gate Level Netlist**:
   - Convert the RTL code into a gate-level netlist using synthesis tools such as Synopsys Design Compiler or Cadence Genus.
   - Optimize the netlist for area, power, and timing constraints.<br>


-**Back End** involves the following steps:

4. **Static Timing Analysis (STA)**:
   - Perform STA to ensure that timing requirements are met and that there are no violations.
   - Address any timing issues through design modifications or constraints.

5. **Floorplanning and Place-and-Route**:
   - Define the physical layout of the ASIC including placement of functional blocks and routing channels.
   - Use tools like Cadence Innovus or Synopsys ICC for automated place-and-route.

6. **Physical Verification**:
   - Perform Design Rule Checking (DRC) and Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) checks to ensure layout correctness and adherence to manufacturing rules.
   - Address any violations found during physical verification.
   - GDS II file will be forwarded to foundry.
7. **Post-Silicon Validation**:
   - Fabricate the ASIC using semiconductor manufacturing processes.
   - Test and validate the fabricated ASIC to ensure functionality and performance meet specifications.

8. **Production and Deployment**:
   - Once validated, the ASIC is ready for mass production.
   - Deploy the ASIC in the target application or market.

## OpenLane:

**OpenLane** uses SkyWater's 130nm Process Design Kit (PDK) and incorporates many open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools for each of the above-mentioned flow steps. Some of the EDA tools used in OpenLane include:

- RTL Synthesis, Technology Mapping, and Formal Verification: Yosys + ABC
- Static Timing Analysis: OpenSTA
- Floor Planning: init_fp, ioPlacer, pdn, and tapcell
- Placement: RePLace (Global), Resizer, OpenPhySyn (formerly), OpenDP (Detailed)
- Clock Tree Synthesis: TritonCTS
- Fill Insertion: OpenDP/filler_placement
- Routing: FastRoute or CU-GR (formerly), TritonRoute (Detailed) or DR-CU
- SPEF Extraction: OpenRCX or SPEF-Extractor (formerly)
- GDSII Streaming out: Magic and KLayout
- DRC Checks: Magic and KLayout
- LVS check: Netgen
- Antenna Checks: Magic
- Circuit Validity Checker: CVC

The main goal of OpenLane was to create an open-source RTL to GDSII platform that generates a GDSII file without requiring human intervention. We can run OpenLane flow in **interactive mode** too using **"-interactive"** option. OpenLane design flow is described by the below image.

![OpenLane Design Flow]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/dc4855df-cec1-4bbc-8e01-4fffd0683d7b)
<br>

## Getting Started

To list the tools and PDKs we will be using, follow these steps in your terminal:

1. Navigate to the work folder on your desktop using the `cd` command:
   ```bash
   cd Desktop/
   cd work/
   cd vsdflow/
   cd work/
   cd tools/
   ls -ltr
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_28_2024 10_31_20 AM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/ef50c22e-12cb-4ea6-b6d1-499dac790d76)


2. Whatever work we will be doing, it will be in the openlane directory, to open it follow the below steps in terminal,
   ```bash
   cd Desktop/
   cd work/
   cd tools/
   cd openlane_working_dir/
   cd openlane/


3. To run OpenLane in interactive mode follow the following steps after opening the openlane directory as shown in above image:
   ```bash
   docker
   pwd
   ./flow.tcl -interactive
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_28_2024 11_40_27 AM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/e7efc385-c70f-4b3e-bd4b-b9fb45e87d41)

<br><br><br>
## The design flow of Picorv32a:


When we open the picorv32a directory in the terminal under the designs directory of the OpenLane directory, we will only see 3 files:

- `SRC` (which contains a Verilog-A file "picorv32a.v" & an SDC file that contains design constraints and timing assignments "picorv32a.sdc")
- `sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl`
- `config.tcl`

The order of timing and design parameters is as follows: `sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl` > `config.tcl` > `OpenLane default values`.

After opening OpenLane in interactive mode as shown above, we will begin the flow by creating various files needed using the command:

    `package require openlane 0.9<br>
    prep -design picorv32a`

If we list out the contents of picorv32a directory now we will see the new directory named runs created,
![Captures 3_28_2024 12_30_39 PM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/447c1b1b-8f20-4e4d-911c-671884346695)




If we open the runs directory, we will find various new directories like `results`,`reports`logs`,`temp` created to store the various outputs of the design flow.
![Captures 3_28_2024 12_34_25 PM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/746ef496-c437-4acc-bfcd-c9bcdfba7f42)



After preperation is completed we run synthesis using the command <br>
`run_synthesis`
<br>
openlane will run synthesis as well as Static Timing Analysis (STA) under the above command itself. After completion of the synthesis we will get a report as shown below.

### Task-1:
**Flop Ratio:** It is the ratio of total number of D flip-flops to the total number of cells in a design.<br>
flop ratio = number of D flip-flop รท total number of cells<br>
<br>
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_28_2024 1_17_45 PM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/8dfac853-d159-4c57-b419-92e2bcadb1e1)

Total number of D flip-flop in the design = 1613 <br>
<br>
![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/ac67613d-e0d2-4d3f-aa90-17840d5e2e5e)

Total number of cells in the design = 14876<br>
therefore, flop ratio = 1613/14876 = 0.108429<br>
Therefore, the flop percentage = 10.84%

After synthesis, we initiate floor planning using:<br>

   `run_floorplan`

After floor planning, we initiate placement using the following command in OpenLane:

      
      run_placement
 
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_28_2024 6_34_10 PM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/869b02f6-0d51-4f03-ac34-c04d23306dc4)


We can visualize the placement in Magic using the following in terminal in `placement` directory of `result` directory:
     
      
      
      magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.placement.def &

# Day-3

## Importing vsdstdcell design from GitHub & analyzing using Magic Layout:

We need to clone the custom standard inverter repo [vsdstdcelldesign](https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign).
Follow the following steps in terminal to clone the above mentioned repo into openlane directory.
       
         cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
         git clone https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign


We can verify weather the cloning was sucessful or not using `ls -ltr` to list the contents of openlane directory.
Now we need to copy the magic tech files from pdks directory to our vsdstcelldesign directory to avoid giving the complete address of tech file every time we use `magic -T` command to view the layout, navigateto the magic tech files and follow the steps shown below,



         cd /Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic
         cp sky130A.tech Home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/vsdstdcelldesign
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_29_2024 1_43_30 PM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/031697ec-7f35-4023-a15f-f9bb05e6678e)

         
<br> <br>         

now we can open the downloaded vsdstdcell inverter using magic tool,

      cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/vsdstdcelldesign
      magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_inv.mag &
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_29_2024 3_07_38 PM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/107c1a44-3421-40e1-94bf-ce6138c61ad9)


### Verifying the different layers & connection of the inverter:

To know about a layer, place your cursor on it and press `s` from your keyboard, which will select the layer/cell, now type `what` in `tkcon` window of magic, it will give the name of the layer. 

![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_29_2024 8_01_57 PM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/eb79f204-a5b5-4f93-a56d-45b9b0bede0a)

To verify or know about the connectivity of a layer, place your cursor on the layer and press `s` twice or thrice, magic will highlight all the connections of the desired layer.


Verifying the connectivity of output with the drain of PMOS & NMOS
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_29_2024 8_21_43 PM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/7aacaa60-52d4-4c58-bbc8-b5f8de3b7965)



Verifying the connectivity of source of PMOS to Vdd
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_29_2024 8_22_00 PM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/af1527ea-da16-4406-975e-330daefa1601)


### DRC error in Magic

Whenever a DRC error occurs, find the error by navigating to `DRC` in magic and clicking on `DRC Find next error`, the tkcon window will display what error we have & according to that design needs to be corrected.

![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_29_2024 9_42_54 PM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/5c1dc88f-7bfd-4466-ad91-ebbb77c38790)



DRC error being highlighted

### SPICE extraction of inverter

To know in which which directory our tkcon window is opened used `pwd` command. Then use the command `extract all` command in tkcon window, this will create a new `.ext` in the same directory.

![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_30_2024 10_27_43 AM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/a7ac6390-4287-44da-ab51-700763d0d3ef)



Verifying weather `.ext` file has been created or not.
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_30_2024 10_27_51 AM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/0621a4b5-6536-444e-9a6a-cbc44193bdd8)




To get SPICE of `.spice` format, we use the following commands 


      ext2spice cthresh 0 rthresh 0
      ext2spice

To open the SPICE file, use the command `less (file name)`
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_30_2024 10_34_41 AM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/ced6dba1-ed2f-4850-bdf1-fa7696928ffd)



To measure the size of unit grid box in magic, select one grid box & use the command `box` in `tkcon` window, whose output will look like the below image
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_30_2024 10_54_46 AM]![image](https://github.com/iamavi07/PHYSICAL-DESIGN-USING-OPENLANE-SKY130/assets/122794054/69edf9a3-fb9f-403f-8a97-27304e73bbd3)



### Editing the SPICE file

`.spice` is edited as shown below in txt editor
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_30_2024 11_40_28 AM](https://github.com/tejasbg19/VSDIAT_Advanced_Physical_Design_Using_Skywater130nm_PDK/assets/163899793/c82377c4-4358-4517-9c74-b2cf8deb3b94)


after editing, install the ngspice simulator & run the `.spice` file as shown below
    
      

      sudo apt install ngspice 
      // password= vsdiat
      ngspice sky130_inv.spice

### Task-3
#### Characterization of the plot:
**Rise Transition:** The time taken by the output waveform to transit from a value of 20% of the maximum value to the 80 % of the maximum value.

Using right click, a new zoomed plot window cab be opened
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_30_2024 12_07_22 PM](https://github.com/tejasbg19/VSDIAT_Advanced_Physical_Design_Using_Skywater130nm_PDK/assets/163899793/b86c759b-166c-4617-811a-603cc5b49962)

ngspice will give the x & y coordinates of a point by just clicking on the points in plot.
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_30_2024 12_22_30 PM](https://github.com/tejasbg19/VSDIAT_Advanced_Physical_Design_Using_Skywater130nm_PDK/assets/163899793/b553a03c-deb5-4485-9830-cd9d89d3c804)

Therefore, Rise transition time = (2.24684 - 2.18233)ns = 0.06451ns 



**Fall Transition:** The time taken by the output waveform to transit from a value of 80% of the maximum value to the 20 % of the maximum value.
![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_30_2024 12_44_16 PM](https://github.com/tejasbg19/VSDIAT_Advanced_Physical_Design_Using_Skywater130nm_PDK/assets/163899793/42db019b-45d7-456d-a4ad-c25fa84b033e)

Therefore the fall transition time = (4.09557 - 4.05304)ns = 0.04253ns 




**Rise Cell Delay /Rise Propagation Delay:** It is the diffrence time taken by Output to rise to 50% & Time taken by Input to fall to 50%

Therefor, Rise cell delay = (4.07805 - 4.05005)ns = 0.028ns


**Fall Cell Delay/ Fall Propagation Delay:** It is the difference time taken by Output to fall to 50% & Time taken by Input to rise to 50%
<br> similar to above we calculate the fall dealy


### Task-4
#### Identifying DRC errors in downloaded magic design & rectifying them:

Here we will download some deigns which have DRC errors and correct them as [the rules](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/rules/periphery.html)
<br><br>
We will download designs from [open circuits archive](http://opencircuitdesign.com/open_pdks/archive/drc_tests.tgz) following the below steps,


   
      // we will download it in home directory
      cd 
      wget http://opencircuitdesign.com/open_pdks/archive/drc_tests.tgz
      // to extract the compressed file
      tar xfz drc_tests.tgz
      cd drc_tests
      // to list all the compnents of the folder
      ls -al
      // to open magic in better quality
      magic -d XR &

#### DRC failure to identify poly to polyresistor distance violation

![vsdworkshop  Running  - Oracle VM VirtualBox 3_30_2024 5_55_13 PM](https://github.com/tejasbg19/VSDIAT_Advanced_Physical_Design_Using_Skywater130nm_PDK/assets/163899793/d74968d2-e373-4e22-82f3-5a24f8d4ffcd)
As we can see in the above image even tough the height of the box or distance between poly & polyresisitor is 21um, we are not getting a DRC error(incorrect poly.9), we need to rectify it.

Then to load the newly edited tech file into magic use the below code in `tkcon` window of magic,
      
      
     
      tech load sky130A.tech
      drc check

## Section 4 - Pre-layout timing analysis and importance of good clock tree (26/03/2024 - 28/03/2024)

### Theory

### Implementation

* Section 4 tasks:-
1. Fix up small DRC errors and verify the design is ready to be inserted into our flow.
2. Save the finalized layout with custom name and open it.
3. Generate lef from the layout.
4. Copy the newly generated lef and associated required lib files to 'picorv32a' design 'src' directory.
5. Edit 'config.tcl' to change lib file and add the new extra lef into the openlane flow.
6. Run openlane flow synthesis with newly inserted custom inverter cell.
7. Remove/reduce the newly introduced violations with the introduction of custom inverter cell by modifying design parameters.
8. Once synthesis has accepted our custom inverter we can now run floorplan and placement and verify the cell is accepted in PnR flow.
9. Do Post-Synthesis timing analysis with OpenSTA tool.
10. Make timing ECO fixes to remove all violations.
11. Replace the old netlist with the new netlist generated after timing ECO fix and implement the floorplan, placement and cts.
12. Post-CTS OpenROAD timing analysis.
13. Explore post-CTS OpenROAD timing analysis by removing 'sky130_fd_sc_hd__clkbuf_1' cell from clock buffer list variable 'CTS_CLK_BUFFER_LIST'.

#### 8. Once synthesis has accepted our custom inverter we can now run floorplan and placement and verify the cell is accepted in PnR flow.

Now that our custom inverter is properly accepted in synthesis we can now run floorplan using following command

```tcl
# Now we can run floorplan
run_floorplan
```

Since we are facing unexpected un-explainable error while using `run_floorplan` command, we can instead use the following set of commands available based on information from `Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/scripts/tcl_commands/floorplan.tcl` and also based on `Floorplan Commands` section in `Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/docs/source/OpenLANE_commands.md`

```tcl
# Follwing commands are alltogather sourced in "run_floorplan" command
init_floorplan

#### 9. Do Post-Synthesis timing analysis with OpenSTA tool.

Since we are having 0 wns after improved timing run we are going to do timing analysis on initial run of synthesis which has lots of violations and no parameters were added to improve timing

Commands to invoke the OpenLANE flow include new lef and perform synthesis 

```bash
# Change directory to openlane flow directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
# Since we have aliased the long command to 'docker' we can invoke the OpenLANE flow docker sub-system by just running this command
docker
```
```tcl
# Now that we have entered the OpenLANE flow contained docker sub-system we can invoke the OpenLANE flow in the Interactive mode using the following command
./flow.tcl -interactive

# Now that OpenLANE flow is open we have to input the required packages for proper functionality of the OpenLANE flow
package require openlane 0.9

# Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
prep -design picorv32a

# Adiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis
```

Since more fanout is causing more delay we can add parameter to reduce fanout and do synthesis again

Commands to include new lef and perform synthesis 

```tcl
# Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
prep -design picorv32a -tag 25-03_18-52 -overwrite

*We started ECO fixes at wns -23.9000 and now we stand at wns -22.6173 we reduced around 1.2827 ns of violation*

#### 11. Replace the old netlist with the new netlist generated after timing ECO fix and implement the floorplan, placement and cts.

Now to insert this updated netlist to PnR flow and we can use `write_verilog` and overwrite the synthesis netlist but before that we are going to make a copy of the old old netlist

Commands to make copy of netlist

```bash
# Change from home directory to synthesis results directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/25-03_18-52/results/synthesis/

# List contents of the directory
ls

# Copy and rename the netlist
cp picorv32a.synthesis.v picorv32a.synthesis_old.v

# List contents of the directory
ls
```

Since we confirmed that netlist is replaced and will be loaded in PnR but since we want to follow up on the earlier 0 violation design we are continuing with the clean design to further stages

Commands load the design and run necessary stages

```tcl
# Now once again we have to prep design so as to update variables
prep -design picorv32a -tag 24-03_10-03 -overwrite

# Addiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow merged.lef
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_STRATEGY
set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING

# Follwing commands are alltogather sourced in "run_floorplan" command
init_floorplan
place_io

## Section 5 - Final steps for RTL2GDS using tritonRoute and openSTA (29/03/2024 - 30/03/2024)

### Theory

### Implementation

* Section 5 tasks:-
1. Perform generation of Power Distribution Network (PDN) and explore the PDN layout.
2. Perfrom detailed routing using TritonRoute.
3. Post-Route parasitic extraction using SPEF extractor.
4. Post-Route OpenSTA timing analysis with the extracted parasitics of the route.

* All section 5 logs, reports and results can be found in following run folder:

[Section 5 Run - 26-03_08-45](https://github.com/fayizferosh/advanced-pd-using-openlane-sky130/tree/main/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/26-03_08-45)

#### 1. Perform generation of Power Distribution Network (PDN) and explore the PDN layout.

Commands to perform all necessary stages up until now

```bash
# Change directory to openlane flow directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
# Since we have aliased the long command to 'docker' we can invoke the OpenLANE flow docker sub-system by just running this command
docker
```
```tcl
# Now that we have entered the OpenLANE flow contained docker sub-system we can invoke the OpenLANE flow in the Interactive mode using the following command
./flow.tcl -interactive

# Now that OpenLANE flow is open we have to input the required packages for proper functionality of the OpenLANE flow
package require openlane 0.9

# Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
prep -design picorv32a

# Addiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow merged.lef
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_STRATEGY
set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis

# Following commands are alltogather sourced in "run_floorplan" command
init_floorplan
place_io
tap_decap_or

# Now we are ready to run placement
run_placement

# Incase getting error
unset ::env(LIB_CTS)

# With placement done we are now ready to run CTS
run_cts

# Now that CTS is done we can do power distribution network
gen_pdn 
```
